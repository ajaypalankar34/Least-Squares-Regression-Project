# Least-Squares-Regression-Project
The theme of this exercise was to learn about how to utilize least squares regression in python, specifically for the purpose of finding the optima values, a and b, of a function. Gradient descent is to be utilized with various step sizes such as diminishing step size, fixed step size, exact line search, and backtracking line search.
